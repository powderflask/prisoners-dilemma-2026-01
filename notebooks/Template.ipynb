        "Your class must subclass `axelrod.Player` and implement a `strategy(self, opponent)` method that returns an `Action`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key points:\n",
        "- Import types: `from axelrod import Player, Action`\n",
        "- Return values:\n",
        "  - `Action.C` = Cooperate\n",
        "  - `Action.D` = Defect\n",
        "- Method signature:\n",
        "  - `def strategy(self, opponent: Player) -> Action:`\n",
        "    - make your next move! `self` is your `Player`; `opponent` is the opposing `Player`;  return an `Action`\n",
        "- Useful data you can use:\n",
        "  - `self.history`: list of your past `Action`s (one per previous turn).\n",
        "  - `opponent.history`: list of the opponent's past `Action`s.\n",
        "  - `zip(self.history, opponent.history)` to get the complete match history as a list of 2-tuples\n",
        "  - You can check previous move safely with: `opponent.history[-1] if opponent.history else None`.\n",
        "  - You can use any standard Python modules you import (e.g., `random`).\n",
        "\n",
        "Constraints for this assignment:\n",
        "- Give your `Player` class an unique name AND provide a user-friendly `name` attribute for display in results.\n",
        "- Provide a docstring listing the student(s) who worked on the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tip: Keep your Player class focused and readable. Test it by running this notebook before submitting."
